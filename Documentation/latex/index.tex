A shooter game developed with Qt Creator (C++) under open-\/source license. Bus\+Destroyer 2000 has a game map of Tampere City Center and Nysse-\/buses and Passengers moving on the map.

The project was made by Miikka Mensio and fellow student/project partner in fall 2020 as a school project. We have developed our work under the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_student_side}{Student\+Side}} namespace so that there would be less confusion about which part is from Course\+Side and which made by us. The project is open-\/source and is not in any way commercialized.

Doxygen documentation has been created inside the Doxygen\+Documentation -\/folder (which can be found inside Documentation -\/folder) and inside there is index.\+html -\/file from which a documentation of this project can be viewed in a web browser.

All the relevant documentation of our project can be found inside the Documentation -\/folder, which is located in our repo root.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{How to start the game}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
